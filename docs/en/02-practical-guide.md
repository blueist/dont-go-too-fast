## Before You Start: Not What, but How

Before reading this document, one question:

**Have you read Clean Code?**   
**Do you know SOLID principles?**   
**Have you heard of TDD?**   

Probably "yes".

**Then why do you use global variables on Friday afternoon before a deadline?**

This is the core of this document.

```
Many developers:
"Clean Code? I know it"
"SOLID? Sure"
"TDD? I've heard of it"

Reality:
Friday afternoon 5 PM
Manager: "When will this be done?"
→ "Let me just use a global variable..."
→ "Hardcoding would be faster..."
→ "Tests? Later..."
```

**The problem isn't not knowing "What".
The problem is not knowing "How".**

- What: Clean Code, SOLID, TDD (already know)
- How: How to follow them under pressure? (this is what you need)

**ROD, TFD, DGTF are the answers to "How".**

This document isn't just a methodology explanation.
It's a guide to transform "knowing but not doing" into "knowing and able to do".

# Part 1: Theoretical Foundation of Software Development

### Three Core Theories

To understand this methodology, you first need to know three validated theories.

----------

### 1. Daniel Kahneman's Dual Process Theory (Human Thinking)

**System 1 (Fast Thinking)**

- Characteristics:
	- Automatic, unconscious
	- Requires little effort
	- Quick judgment
	- Emotional
	- Pattern recognition

- Advantages:
	- Immediate response
	- Efficient
	- Energy saving

- Disadvantages:
	- Vulnerable to bias
	- Error-prone
	- Unsuitable for complex problems
	- Poor decisions under pressure


**System 2 (Slow Thinking)**

- Characteristics:
	- Intentional, conscious
	- Requires focus and effort
	- Careful analysis
	- Logical
	- Reasoning

- Advantages:
	- Accurate judgment
	- Complex problem solving
	- Long-term thinking

- Disadvantages:
	- Slow
	- Tiring
	- Energy consuming
	- Deactivates under pressure

**Impact on Software Development:**

- Design Phase (time available):
	- System 2 can be activated
	- Deep thinking
	- Complete design

- Implementation Phase (pressure):
	- System 1 naturally dominant
	- Quick judgment
	- Risk of poor rushed decisions

**Key:**
"Which system you use at which phase matters"


----------

### 2. Donella H. Meadows' Systems Thinking (Understanding Systems)

**What is Systems Thinking:**

- Definition:
	System = collection of interconnected elements
	The whole is greater than the simple sum of parts

- Core Principles:
	1. See the whole
	   - Seeing only parts misses the whole
	2. Understand relationships
	   - Connections between elements matter
	3. Identify feedback loops
	   - Output affects input
	4. Find leverage points
	   - Small changes, big effects
	5. Define system boundaries
	   - What's inside and outside

**Impact on Software Development:**

- Local vs Global Optimization:
	- Even if each function is optimized
	- The overall system may be slow
	- Relationships and flow matter

- Danger of Missing:
	- If part of the system is missing
	- Unpredictable behavior
	- Whole doesn't work

- Leverage Points:
	- Design phase = most powerful intervention point
	- Hundreds of times more effective than post-implementation fixes

----------

### 3. Genrich Altshuller's TRIZ (Problem Solving)

**What is TRIZ:**

- Theory of Inventive Problem Solving

- Source:
	- Analysis of millions of patents
	- Discovery of innovation patterns
	- Repeatable methodology

**Core Concepts:**

1. Technical Contradiction
   "Improving A makes B worse"
   Example: "Fast development" vs "High quality"
   
2. TRIZ Resolution Principle
   "Resolve contradictions, don't compromise"
   Methods:
   - Separation in time (at different times)
   - Separation in space (at different places)
   - Separation by condition (in different situations)
   
3. Ideal Final Result (IFR)
   "What if the problem solved itself without additional resources?"
   
4. 40 Inventive Principles
   - Segmentation, Extraction, Prior Action, Prior Counteraction, etc.
   - Repeatable solution patterns


**Impact on Software Development:**

- Traditional Compromise:
	"Fast" → sacrifice quality
	"Quality first" → sacrifice speed

- TRIZ Solution: Apply time separation
	- Design Phase: Slow and accurate
	- Implementation Phase: Fast (follow design)
	- Result: Fast AND high quality

- Ideal Final Result:
"What if confusion disappeared by itself during implementation?"
→ ROD: Make it complete in the design phase

----------

└─────────────────────────────────┘

```

**Software Development Problem Analysis:**

Problem:
- "Must create high-quality software under deadline pressure"

- Kahneman Analysis:
	- Pressure → System 1 activation
	- System 1 → Poor rushed decisions
	- Result → Technical debt, bugs

- Meadows Analysis:
	- Seeing only parts causes Missing
	- Missing → Incomplete system
	- Adding during implementation → More confusion

- Altshuller Analysis:
	- "Speed" vs "Quality" = Contradiction
	- Compromise makes both worse
	- Resolve with separation principle

Solution → ROD + TFD + DGTF


**Practical Application in Programming:**

- Pressure Situation:
"Create login feature by tomorrow"

- ❌ Traditional Approach (compromise):
	System 1: "Let's make it fast!"
	→ Skip design
	→ Skip tests
	→ Hardcoding
	→ Global variables
	Result: Fast but poor quality

- ✅ ROD + TFD + DGTF (resolve contradiction):
	
	1. Time Separation (TRIZ):
	   - This afternoon (2 hours): Design + Tests
		   - System 2 active (Kahneman)
		   - Complete system (Meadows)
	   - Tomorrow morning (3 hours): Implementation
		   - Follow design
		   - Control with DGTF
	   
	2. Result:
	   Total 5 hours
	   High quality
	   No rework


----------

## Part 2: ROD (Responsibility-Oriented Design)

### Core Principle

**"More is better than missing"**

This doesn't mean "make more", but:

> If you define completely in the design phase (Meadows: whole system), unnecessary things can be easily removed during implementation, but adding missing things is dangerous (Kahneman: System 1 rampage)

### ROD is Not a New "What"

Let's be honest.

**ROD isn't completely new:**
- Clean Architecture? Similar.
- Service-Oriented Design? Yes.
- Domain-Driven Design? Overlapping parts exist.

**But the question:**

```
You know Clean Architecture.
You know SOLID.
You know dependency injection.

But why?
Why don't you follow them when deadline approaches?
Why does it become "just make it work, fix later"?
```

**ROD is not a new technology.**  
ROD is the answer to **"Why"**, **"When"**, **"How"** to do good design.

**Comparison:**

```
Clean Architecture:
"Structure it like this"
→ What (what to do)

ROD:
"Why to do it this way" (Kahneman: System 1 prevention)
"When to do it this way" (in design phase)
"How to keep it" (Constructor/Static prohibition)
→ Why + When + How
```

**Practical Difference:**

```
Developer who knows Clean Architecture:  
Design phase: "Should apply dependency inversion"
Implementation phase (pressure): "No time, let me just new..."
→ Knows principles but can't follow

Developer who internalized ROD:
Design phase: "Must complete service chain to prevent System 1"
Implementation phase (pressure): "Just need to follow service chain"
→ Became habit, automatically followed
```

----------

### Theoretical Background

**Systems Thinking Perspective (Meadows):**

- Systems Theory:
"A system's behavior is determined by all its elements and their relationships"

- ROD Application:
	- Each service = system element
	- Call relationships = connections between elements
	- Complete chain = whole system
	- Missing = incomplete system → unpredictable

- Design Principles:
	1. Identify all elements (services)
	2. Define all relationships (calls)
	3. Clarify boundaries (interfaces)
	4. Design feedback loops (tests)

**Kahneman Perspective:**

- Problem:
Implementation phase = pressure → System 1 dominant

- When Missing discovered:
	"Huh? I need this but it's not in the design?"
	→ System 1 rampage
	→ "Global variable!", "Singleton!", "Hardcode!"
	→ Poor rushed decision

- ROD Solution:
	Design phase (relaxed) = System 2 active
	→ Complete service chain
	→ No Missing during implementation
	→ Prevent System 1 rampage

**TRIZ Perspective:**

- Ideal Final Result (IFR):
	"What if confusion disappeared by itself during implementation?"

- ROD Answer:
	"If we define everything in design,
 implementation is just following"

- Prior Action Principle:
	- Solve before problem occurs
	- Define everything in design phase
	- No rushed decisions during implementation

- Segmentation Principle:
	- Divide large system into services
	- Develop/test each independently
	- Replaceable (SOLID)

### Change Isolation - ROD's Real Power

**Let's accept reality:**

No matter how perfectly you design,  
changes happen during implementation.

- Requirements change
- Discover a better way
- Need to fix bugs

**The problem isn't change itself.  
The problem is change spreading everywhere.**

**Practical Example - When change spreads:**

```go
// ❌ Bad design: direct dependency
type LoginHandler struct {
    db *sql.DB  // direct dependency
}

func (h *LoginHandler) Login(username, password string) (*User, error) {
    // Direct DB access
    row := h.db.QueryRow("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", username)
    
    // Password verification here too
    if !checkPassword(user.Password, password) {
        return nil, errors.New("invalid password")
    }
    
    // Session creation here too
    session := createSession(user)
    
    // Token generation here too
    token := generateToken(session)
    
    return user, nil
}

// Problem: Request to change password verification method
// → Need to modify LoginHandler
// → Modify all tests
// → Affects session logic?
// → Affects token logic?
// → System 1: "Just fix here... and there too..."
```

**Practical Example - Change isolated with ROD:**

```go
// ✅ ROD design: service chain

// Each service is independent
type PasswordVerifier interface {
    Verify(plain, hashed string) (bool, error)
}

type UserFinder interface {
    FindByUsername(username string) (*User, error)
}

type SessionCreator interface {
    Create(user *User) (*Session, error)
}

type TokenGenerator interface {
    Generate(session *Session) (string, error)
}

// LoginService only connects the chain
type LoginService struct {
    userFinder       UserFinder
    passwordVerifier PasswordVerifier
    sessionCreator   SessionCreator
    tokenGenerator   TokenGenerator
}

func (s *LoginService) Login(username, password string) (string, error) {
    user, err := s.userFinder.FindByUsername(username)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    
    valid, err := s.passwordVerifier.Verify(password, user.HashedPassword)
    if err != nil || !valid {
        return "", errors.New("invalid credentials")
    }
    
    session, err := s.sessionCreator.Create(user)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    
    return s.tokenGenerator.Generate(session)
}

// Change password verification method?
// → Only replace PasswordVerifier implementation
// → No impact on other services
// → No LoginService code change
// → Only modify PasswordVerifier tests
```

**Contract between "Service End" and "Next Service Start":**

```
┌──────────────────┐    Contract(Interface)   ┌──────────────────┐
│  UserFinder      │ ──────────────────────→ │  PasswordVerifier │
│                  │      *User              │                   │
│  Internal impl:  │                         │  Internal impl:   │
│  - SQL? NoSQL?   │                         │  - bcrypt? argon2?│
│  - Cache? Direct?│                         │  - External svc?  │
│                  │                         │                   │
│  Change freely   │                         │  Change freely    │
└──────────────────┘                         └──────────────────┘

As long as Contract(Interface) is maintained:
- Internals can change freely
- No impact on other services
- Even if System 1 activates, damage is limited to one service
```

**This is the real reason "Why" to follow SOLID:**

Requirements change frequently during implementation   
→ Define each service with interface (replaceable)   
→ Requirement change = Service replacement   
→ No impact on other parts   
→ No need for System 1's poor rushed decisions   

- Single Responsibility: Each service has one responsibility → Minimize change scope
- Open-Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification → Protect existing code
- Liskov Substitution: Services are replaceable → Flexible response
- Interface Segregation: Only necessary interfaces → Remove unnecessary dependencies
- Dependency Inversion: Depend on interfaces → Isolate changes

----------

### Implementation Phase Problems

**Under Pressure (Kahneman + Meadows):**

- Situation:
	- Deadline pressure
	- Requirement changes
	- Lack of time

- Kahneman Analysis:
	→ Stress
	→ System 1 dominance
	→ "I need to solve this fast!"

- Meadows Analysis:
	→ Seeing only parts
	→ Missing the whole system
	→ Discovering Missing

- Combined Effect:
	Missing discovered + System 1 active
	→ "How do I make this?"
	→ First solution that comes to mind
	→ "Global variable!", "Singleton!"
	→ Technical debt

### Service Chain Concept (Systems Thinking)

**What is a Service Chain:**

- Applying Meadows' Systems Thinking:
	System = network of services
	- Each service = system node
	- Call relationships = system edges
	- Data flow = system feedback

Example: User Login System
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Login System (whole)            │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│                                 │
│ ValidateCredentialsFormat       │
│         ↓                       │
│ FindUserByUsername              │
│         ↓                       │
│ VerifyPassword                  │
│         ↓                       │
│ CheckAccountStatus              │
│         ↓                       │
│ CreateSession                   │
│         ↓                       │
│ StoreSession                    │
│         ↓                       │
│ GenerateSessionToken            │
│         ↓                       │
│ LogLoginEvent                   │
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```
- Characteristics:
	- Each service: Clear responsibility (single)
	- Connection: Explicit call relationships
	- Whole: Complete system
	- No Missing: All elements defined



**Leverage Point (Meadows):**

- Meadows' Lesson:
	"System structure determines behavior"
	"Most powerful intervention point is structural level"

- ROD Application: 
	- Design phase = Structure definition
		- Define all services
		- Define all relationships
		- Define interfaces
	- Implementation phase = Behavior implementation
		- Follow already defined structure
		- Minimize structure changes

- Effect:
	Invest 2 hours in design phase →
	Save 10 hours in implementation phase


### Constructor/Static Prohibition Rule

**TRIZ Perspective - Prior Counteraction Principle:**

- Prior Counteraction:
	"Block in advance what can cause problems"

- Problems with Constructor/Static:
	1. System 1's escape route
	   "Need to make it fast"
	   → "Just new User()"
	   → Skip service design
	   
	2. Hiding Missing
	   "Where does User come from?"
	   → Question doesn't arise
	   → Missing not discovered

- ROD Enforcement:
	- Constructor/Static prohibited
	→ "Need User? Create UserFinderService"
	→ Force Missing discovery
	→ Complete service chain

**Kahneman Perspective:**

Allowing Constructor = Providing easy path for System 1

- Design Phase (System 2):
	- Developer: "Need User"
	        "How to get it?"
	        "DB? API? Cache?"
	        → Doesn't think (because Constructor exists)

- Implementation Phase (System 1):
	- "Need User!"
	→ "new User()" (immediate reaction)
	→ Thoughtless decision

- ROD Enforcement = Block System 1's easy path
	→ Force System 2 thinking
	→ Complete design

### How to Find "Missing" (Systems Thinking)

**System Analysis Technique:**

- Meadows' Question:
"To fully understand the system?"

1. Identify all elements
   ❓ "Where does this object come from?"
   → Missing if no service!
   
2. Identify all relationships
   ❓ "How to get this data?"
   → Missing if no service!
   
3. Identify all transformations
   ❓ "How to make this?"
   → Missing if no service!
   
4. Identify all storage
   ❓ "How to store this?"
   → Missing if no service!
   
5. Identify all validations
   ❓ "How to validate this?"
   → Missing if no service!
   
6. Identify all error handling
   ❓ "How to handle errors?"
   → Missing if no service!

### Practical Example: User Login

**❌ Design with Missing (incomplete system):**

- Service Chain:
	1. ValidateCredentials(username, password)
	2. CreateSession(user)  // ← Where does user come from?

- Systems Thinking Analysis:
	- Element missing: User object
	- Relationship missing: How to get User
	- Transformation missing: password verification
	- Validation missing: account status

- Result:
→ Incomplete system
→ Unpredictable behavior
→ Confusion during implementation

**✅ ROD (complete system):**

Complete Service Chain:

1. ValidateCredentialsFormat(username, password)
   Role: Input format validation
   Systems Thinking: Boundary validation (system entry)
   
2. FindUserByUsername(username)
   Role: User lookup
   Systems Thinking: Data retrieval element
   
3. VerifyPassword(user, password)
   Role: Password verification
   Systems Thinking: Security validation element
   
4. CheckAccountStatus(user)
   Role: Account status check
   Systems Thinking: Status validation element
   
5. CreateSession(user)
   Role: Session creation
   Systems Thinking: State creation element
   
6. StoreSession(session)
   Role: Session storage
   Systems Thinking: Persistence element
   
7. GenerateSessionToken(session)
   Role: Token generation
   Systems Thinking: Output transformation element
   
8. LogLoginEvent(user, timestamp)
   Role: Login event logging
   Systems Thinking: Feedback/monitoring element

- Systems Thinking Verification:  
✓ All elements identified  
✓ All relationships clear  
✓ System boundary defined  
✓ Feedback loop exists  
✓ No Missing  

- TRIZ Verification:  
✓ Prior action complete  
✓ Segmentation principle applied  
✓ Self-contained  

- Kahneman Verification:  
✓ Designed with System 2  
✓ System 1 rampage prevention during implementation  

### Practical Example: Payment System

**TRIZ + Systems Thinking Integration:**

- TRIZ Analysis:
	- Problem: Payment system is complex with many error possibilities
	- Principles: Segmentation + Prior Action + Prior Counteraction

- Systems Thinking Analysis:
	- Multiple subsystems
	- Complex relationships
	- Many feedback loops
	- External system dependencies

- Integrated Design:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Payment System (whole)              │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│ Input Validation Subsystem:         │
│ 1. ValidatePaymentRequest           │
│ 2. FindUserAccount                  │
│ 3. CheckUserPaymentEligibility      │
│                                     │
│ Calculation Subsystem:              │
│ 4. CalculateTotalAmount             │
│ 5. CheckInventoryAvailability       │
│                                     │
│ Reservation Subsystem:              │
│ 6. ReserveInventory                 │
│                                     │
│ Payment Processing Subsystem:       │
│ 7. ValidatePaymentMethod            │
│ 8. CreatePaymentTransaction         │

│ 10. CallPaymentGateway              │
│ 11. DecryptPaymentResponse          │
│ 12. ValidatePaymentResponse         │
│                                     │
│ State Management Subsystem:         │
│ 13. UpdateTransactionStatus         │
│ 14. ConfirmInventoryReservation     │
│                                     │
│ Output Subsystem:                   │
│ 15. CreateOrderRecord               │
│ 16. SendPaymentConfirmation         │
│ 17. UpdateUserPaymentHistory        │
│                                     │
│ Monitoring Subsystem:               │
│ 18. LogPaymentEvent                 │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
- TRIZ Principles Applied:
	- Segmentation: Divided into 6 subsystems
	- Prior Action: All validations first
	- Prior Counteraction: Reservation → Confirmation steps separated

- Systems Thinking:
	- Clear boundaries
	- Explicit relationships
	- Feedback loops (logging, status updates)
	- Complete overall system

- Kahneman:
	- Designed with System 2 (complexity management)
	- Implementation one service at a time
	- Control with DGTF

### Connection with SOLID

**Systems Thinking + SOLID:**

- Meadows:
"Systems change"
"Adaptable systems survive"

- SOLID:
"Open for extension, closed for modification"

- ROD + SOLID:  
Define each service with interface  
→ Replaceable elements  
→ Replace parts without modifying whole system  
→ Adaptable system  

Example:
```go
type PaymentGateway interface {
    Process(PaymentRequest) (PaymentResponse, error)
}

// Implementations
type StripeGateway struct { ... }
type PayPalGateway struct { ... }
type TossGateway struct { ... }
```
- Requirement Change:  
"Change from Stripe to Toss"  
→ Interface stays same  
→ Only replace implementation  
→ No impact on other services  
→ No System 1 rushed decision needed  

### UML and Design Pattern Are Useless?

**Many developers say:**

```
"I learned UML but don't use it in practice"
"I studied Design Pattern but there's nowhere to use it"
"What I learned in school is different from practice"
```

**But the question:**  

When do you draw UML?  
When do you apply Design Pattern?  

```
Most answers:
"When coding if needed..."
"When it gets complex..."
"When refactoring..."
```

**That's the problem.**

UML and Design Pattern are not **implementation phase** tools.  
They are **design phase** tools.

```
❌ Wrong usage:
While implementing → "It's complex" → "Should I draw UML"
→ Already too late
→ Hard to change structure
→ "UML is useless"

✅ Correct usage (ROD):
Design phase → Plan service chain → Express with UML
Design phase → Define relationships → Apply Design Pattern
→ Implementation just follows design
→ "UML/DP is really useful"
```

**Using UML/Design Pattern in ROD Phase:**

```
1. When designing service chain:
   → Class Diagram: Relationships between services
   → Sequence Diagram: Call sequence
   
2. When defining interfaces:
   → Strategy Pattern: Replaceable implementations
   → Factory Pattern: Separate object creation
   → Observer Pattern: Event handling
   
3. When designing complex flows:
   → State Diagram: State transitions
   → Activity Diagram: Business flow
```

**Conclusion:**

```
UML and Design Pattern aren't useless.
Because you implement without ROD phase, there's nowhere to use them.

If you design first (ROD)
→ UML becomes necessary
→ Design Pattern naturally applies
→ "Ah, that's why I learned this"
```

## Part 3: TFD (Test-First Development)

### Core Principle

**"Requirements = Tests"**

Tests are:
-   Specifications, not afterthoughts (Systems Thinking: system specification)
-   Implementation guide
-   Completion criteria
-   Feedback loop (Meadows)


### Test = Requirement: More Practical Examples

**Tests are requirements** - let's understand this more deeply.

**Example 1: Payment System**

```
❌ Traditional requirements (ambiguous):
"Users should be able to make payments"

→ What if card fails?
→ What if insufficient balance?
→ Duplicate payment prevention?
→ Partial refunds?
```

```go
// ✅ TFD requirements (defined as tests):

func TestPaymentService(t *testing.T) {
    // Normal cases
    t.Run("ValidPayment_ShouldSucceed", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Valid card, sufficient balance → Payment success, return receipt
    })
    
    // Card errors
    t.Run("InvalidCard_ShouldReturnCardError", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Invalid card number → CardError, payment not processed
    })
    
    t.Run("ExpiredCard_ShouldReturnExpiredError", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Expired card → ExpiredCardError
    })
    
    // Balance errors
    t.Run("InsufficientFunds_ShouldReturnFundsError", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Insufficient balance → InsufficientFundsError, payment not processed
    })
    
    // Duplicate prevention
    t.Run("DuplicatePayment_ShouldReturnDuplicateError", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Same order payment attempted twice → DuplicatePaymentError
    })
    
    // Partial refund
    t.Run("PartialRefund_ShouldRefundPartialAmount", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Refund 3000 out of 10000 → 3000 refunded, 7000 remaining
    })
    
    // Full refund
    t.Run("FullRefund_ShouldRefundFullAmount", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Full amount refund → Full refund, order cancelled status
    })
    
    // Concurrency
    t.Run("ConcurrentPayments_ShouldHandleCorrectly", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Simultaneous same order payment → Only one succeeds
    })
}

// These tests ARE the requirements.
// PM says "Please prevent duplicate payments"?
// → DuplicatePayment test passes = Done.
```

**Example 2: Search System**

```
❌ Traditional requirements:
"Users should be able to search products"

→ No results?
→ Typo correction?
→ Sort criteria?
→ Pagination?
→ Filtering?
```

```go
// ✅ TFD requirements:

func TestSearchService(t *testing.T) {
    // Normal case
    t.Run("ValidQuery_ShouldReturnResults", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Search "laptop" → Return laptop product list
    })
    
    // No results
    t.Run("NoResults_ShouldReturnEmptyList", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Search "asdfqwer" → Empty list, not an error
    })
    
    // Typo correction
    t.Run("Typo_ShouldSuggestCorrection", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Search "laptpo" → Suggest "Did you mean laptop?"
    })
    
    // Sorting
    t.Run("SortByPrice_ShouldReturnSortedResults", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Sort by price → Price ascending results
    })
    
    t.Run("SortByRelevance_ShouldReturnRelevantFirst", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Sort by relevance → Most relevant first
    })
    
    // Pagination
    t.Run("Pagination_ShouldReturnCorrectPage", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Request page 2 → Results 21-40
    })
    
    t.Run("LastPage_ShouldReturnRemainingItems", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Last page → Remaining items, hasNext=false
    })
    
    // Filtering
    t.Run("PriceFilter_ShouldFilterByPrice", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Filter $100-$500 → Only that price range
    })
    
    t.Run("CategoryFilter_ShouldFilterByCategory", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Filter electronics → Only electronics
    })
    
    // Combination
    t.Run("MultipleFilters_ShouldApplyAll", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Price + Category + Sort → All applied
    })
}
```

**Key:**

```
Test = Requirement = Contract

Requirements change?
→ Change the tests.
→ If tests pass, requirements are satisfied.

PM: "Show recommended products when no search results"
→ Add new test: NoResults_ShouldShowRecommendations
→ Pass the test = Done

Single Source of Truth:
- ❌ Requirements document (outdated, ambiguous)
- ❌ Code comments (not updated)
- ✅ Tests (executable, always current, clear)
```

----------

### Theoretical Background

**Systems Thinking Perspective (Meadows):**

- Feedback Loop:
"System output affects input"

- TFD Feedback:
Test → Implement → Verify → Improve → Test
```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│                              │
│   ┌─────┐      ┌─────┐       │
│   │Test │ ──→ │Impl │       │
│   └─────┘      └─────┘       │
│      ↑            ↓          │
│      │         ┌─────┐       │
│      └──────── │Verify│      │
│                └─────┘       │
│                              │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```
- Systems Theory:
	- Fast feedback = Fast learning
	- Clear criteria = Clear behavior
	- Continuous verification = Stable system

**TRIZ Perspective:**

- Prior Action Principle:
"Solve before problem occurs"

- TFD Application:
	- Test first = Requirements clarification
	- Define verification criteria before implementation
	- Bug prevention

- Reverse Principle:
	"Traditional: Implement → Problem → Fix"
	"TFD: Predict problem → Test → Implement"

- Self-Service Principle:
	"Tests verify themselves"
	→ No manual verification needed
	→ Automated feedback

**Kahneman Perspective:**

- System 2 Utilization:
	Test design = Thoughtful thinking
	- "What cases are there?"
	- "What errors could occur?"
	- "Edge cases?"

- Safety Net During Implementation:
	Tests = Catching System 1's mistakes
	- Even coding quickly
	- Tests catch mistakes
	- Provide confidence

----------

### TFD's Relationship with TDD

**Have you tried TDD?**

```
Attempt 1:
"They said test first..."
→ "What do I test?"
→ Overwhelming
→ "Let me implement first then test..."
→ Give up

Attempt 2:
"Red → Green → Refactor!"
→ Write first test
→ "Is this right?"
→ Test structure keeps changing while implementing
→ "TDD is too hard"
→ Give up

Attempt 3:
"Start with something simple..."
→ Write utility function tests
→ "This is easy!"
→ Complex business logic
→ "What do I test here?"
→ Give up
```

**The real reason TDD is difficult:**

```
TDD's premise:
"Tests drive the design"

Reality:
Test first without design?
→ Don't know "what to test"
→ Test structure keeps changing
→ "What am I even making?"
```

**TFD doesn't negate TDD.
TFD makes TDD easier.**

```
TDD:
Test → Implement → Refactor
"Tests drive the design"

TFD:
Design (ROD) → Test → Implement
"Design defines the tests"
```

**Why TFD is easier:**

```
After ROD complete:
LoginService
├── UserFinder.FindByUsername()
├── PasswordVerifier.Verify()
├── SessionCreator.Create()
└── TokenGenerator.Generate()

Each service's input/output is clear.
"Just test this service's contract"

UserFinder test:
- Input: username (string)
- Output: *User or error
- Tests: existing user, non-existing user, empty string...

Clear what to test.
```

**Conclusion:**

```
Doing TDD well?
→ Congratulations. Keep going.

TDD was difficult?
→ Try ROD first.
→ With service chain, you'll see what tests to write.
```




### ROD and TFD Combination

**Integrated Process (Three Theories Applied):**

- Step 1: ROD (Systems Thinking + Kahneman)
	Complete service chain design
	- Design with System 2
	- Understand whole system
	- Eliminate Missing

- Step 2: TFD (Meadows + TRIZ)
	Design test cases for each service
	- Design feedback loops
	- Prior action (predict problems)
	- Define completion criteria

- Step 3: Implementation (Kahneman + DGTF)
	Implement to pass tests
	- Control System 1 with DGTF
	- Secure safety net with tests
	- Continuous verification

- Step 4: Verification (Meadows)
	All tests pass = Done
	- Confirm feedback
	- Verify system completeness

**Synergy Effect:**

- ROD:
	"What to build" defined
	→ Complete service chain

- TFD:
	"Is it working correctly" verification
	→ Criteria for each service

- Both together:
	= Complete specification
	= Executable documentation
	= Automatic verification system

### Application Method (4 Steps)

**Step 1: Define test cases per service (System 2)**

- Carefully analyze each ROD service:

	- Systems Thinking Questions:
		- What is this service's input?
		- What is this service's output?
		- What transformation occurs?
		- How does it connect to other services?

	- Kahneman Questions (System 2):
		- Normal cases?
		- Abnormal cases?
		- Boundary values?
		- Extreme cases?

	- TRIZ Questions:
		- What contradictions exist?
		- What errors could occur?

- Test Cases:
	1. Normal Case (Happy Path)
	   - Valid input → Expected output
	   
	2. Error Cases
	   - Invalid input → Appropriate error
	   - For each error type
	   
	3. Edge Cases
	   - Boundary values
	   - Extreme inputs
	   - Exception situations
	   
	4. Integration Cases
	   - Interaction with other services
	   
	5. Performance Cases (if needed)
	   - Response time
	   - Throughput

**Step 2: Write test structure**

```go
// Systems Thinking: Overall test system structure
func TestUserService(t *testing.T) {
    // Normal case
    t.Run("ValidInput_ShouldSucceed", func(t *testing.T) {
        // TODO: Write carefully with Kahneman System 2
    })
    
    // Error cases
    t.Run("InvalidEmail_ShouldReturnError", func(t *testing.T) {
        // TODO: TRIZ prior action - predict errors
    })
    
    t.Run("EmptyPassword_ShouldReturnError", func(t *testing.T) {
        // TODO
    })
    
    // Edge cases
    t.Run("VeryLongEmail_ShouldHandleCorrectly", func(t *testing.T) {
        // TODO
    })
    
    // Integration cases
    t.Run("WithDatabaseFailure_ShouldHandleGracefully", func(t *testing.T) {
        // TODO: Systems Thinking - connection failure
    })
}

```

**Step 3: Implement tests one by one (Apply DGTF)**

```go
func TestUserService(t *testing.T) {
    t.Run("ValidInput_ShouldSucceed", func(t *testing.T) {
        // 🛑 DGTF: Slowly, carefully
        
        // Arrange (Setup)
        // Systems Thinking: System configuration
        service := NewUserService(mockRepo)
        email := "user@example.com"
        password := "ValidPass123!"
        
        // Act (Execute)
        result, err := service.CreateUser(email, password)
        
        // Assert (Verify)
        // Meadows: Check feedback
        if err != nil {
            t.Errorf("Expected no error, got %v", err)
        }
        if result == nil {
            t.Error("Expected result, got nil")
        }
        if result.Email != email {
            t.Errorf("Expected email %s, got %s", 
                email, result.Email)
        }
        
        // ✓ Run test
        // ✓ Confirm Red
        // ✓ Implement
        // ✓ Confirm Green
        // ✓ Next test
    })
}

```

**Step 4: Implement while passing tests (Feedback Loop)**

- Meadows Feedback Loop:

- Iteration:
	1. Run test → Fail (Red)
	   Feedback: "Not implemented yet"
	   
	2. Write minimal code
	   DGTF: Carefully
	   
	3. Run test → Pass (Green)
	   Feedback: "This case complete"
	   
	4. Move to next test
	   Systems Thinking: Next element

- Overall Complete:
	→ All tests pass
	→ Complete system
	→ Continuous feedback secured

## Part 4: DGTF (Don't Go Too Fast)

### Core Principle

**"Slow is smooth, smooth is fast"**

Thoughtfulness is:
-   Not slow, but smooth (TRIZ: contradiction resolved)
-   Smooth is ultimately fast
-   Because no rework

### Prerequisite: The "Wow" Moment

**DGTF has a prerequisite.**

DGTF's first step is "Recognize" - recognizing that System 1 is activating.
But here's the paradox:

> When System 1 is fully active, you don't know you're in System 1.

**So who can use DGTF?**

People who have the "Wow" moment:
```
"Wait... is this right?"
"Hmm, something feels off..."
"Hold on, let me think about this..."
```

This brief moment of doubt - this is the "Wow".

**Without Wow:**
- 100% System 1 state
- "Recognize" is impossible
- DGTF cannot be applied
- → First, create conditions for Wow to happen

**With Wow:**
- A door opens briefly
- But without knowing what to do, the door closes
- System 1 says "It's fine, let's go" and moves on
- → DGTF provides the method to use that moment

**Critical Insight:**

```
Wow alone is not enough.
Wow + DGTF = Success

Without DGTF, Wow is just a missed opportunity.
Without Wow, DGTF cannot even start.
```

**This is why DGTF must be learned BEFORE Wow happens.**
When Wow comes, you need to know what to do immediately.

### Theoretical Background

**Kahneman Perspective:**

- Core Problem:
	Pressure → System 1 activation → Bad decisions

- DGTF Solution:
	Activate System 2 even under pressure
	→ Thoughtful judgment
	→ Good decisions

- Method:
	1. Recognize: Detect System 1 trigger
	2. Pause: "Wait, let me think"
	3. Activate: System 2 ON
	4. Proceed: Thoughtfully

**TRIZ Perspective:**

- Contradiction:
"Fast" vs "Thoughtful"

- Traditional Compromise:
	- Fast → Many mistakes
	- Thoughtful → Too slow

- TRIZ Solution: Time Separation   
	- Phase separation:
		  - Design: Slow and thoughtful (System 2)
		  - Implementation: Fast but verified (DGTF)
  	- Iteration separation:
		 - Each iteration: Thoughtfully (25min)
		 - Between: Evaluate (5min)

- Result:
	→ Fast AND thoughtful
	→ Contradiction resolved

**Systems Thinking Perspective:**

- Meadows' Lesson:
	"Rushing misses feedback"

- DGTF Application:
	Continuous feedback checking
	- Verify at each step
	- Run tests
	- Analyze impact

- System Behavior:
	Thoughtful progress = Stable feedback
	→ Early error detection
	→ Quick fix
	→ Faster overall

### Human Psychology Under Pressure

**Kahneman Detailed Analysis:**

- Triggers (System 1 Activation):
	- Internal Triggers:
		- "Need to finish fast"
		- "This is simple anyway"
		- "Can do it roughly"
		- "Tests later"
		- "No time to check"
	- External Triggers:
		- "When will it be done?"
		- "Is tomorrow possible?"
		- "It's simple, right?"
		- "Others did it quickly"
		- "Demo is tomorrow"

- System 1 Activation Signals:
	- Physical:
		- Increased heart rate
		- Shallow breathing
		- Tense shoulders
		- Sweating
	- Mental:
		- Restlessness
		- "Hurry" thoughts repeating
		- Tunnel vision (only see parts)
		- Can't think of other things
	- Behavioral:
		- Rushing
		- Skipping verification
		- Not reading documentation
		- Skipping tests
		- Choosing first solution

- System 1's Typical Decisions:
	- "Just use a global variable!"
	- "Singleton should work!"
	- "Hardcode it here!"
	- "Fix later!"



### Driving Analogy (Three Theories Integration)

**Driver's License ≠ Good Driver**

- Bad Driver (System 1 - Kahneman):
	- Behavior:
		- Quick lane changes
		- Not checking signals
		- Aggressive driving
		- "Need to go fast!"

	- Systems Thinking (Meadows):
		- Not seeing overall traffic flow
		- Ignoring relationships with other cars
		- Ignoring feedback (horns, brakes)
	- Result:
		→ Accident (contradiction worsens - TRIZ)
		→ Stress
		→ Slower overall (accident handling)

- Good Driver (System 2 + DGTF):
	- Behavior:
		- Check ahead of time
		- Consistent speed
		- Maintain safe distance
		- Predictive driving
	- Systems Thinking:
		- Understand overall traffic flow
		- Consider other cars
		- Respond to feedback
	- TRIZ:
		- Contradiction resolved (fast vs safe)
		- Time separation (adjust speed by situation)
	- Result:
		→ No accidents
		→ Comfortable
		→ Faster overall

**Programming is the same:**

- Coding ability ≠ Good programmer
- Good programmer =
	```
	  Technical ability (Skill)
	  + Good habits (DGTF)
	  + Thoughtful attitude (Kahneman System 2)
	  + Systems thinking (Meadows)
	  + Problem solving (TRIZ)
	```

### The LA Analogy

**A manager tells the team: "Go to LA. Fast."**

```
Person D: Starts running toward LA immediately.
          "He said fast! I must go now!"
          → Most effort, slowest result

Person C: Grabs a bicycle.
          "At least I'm doing something..."
          → Compromise, still slow

Person A: Goes home to get his car.
          "Let me get the right tool first."
          → Seems like going backward, but faster

Person B: Searches for airplane schedules.
          "What's the fastest way?"
          → Seems like doing nothing, but fastest
```

**From the outside:**
- D looks the most hardworking (running!)
- A looks like he's going the wrong direction
- B looks like he's just sitting there

**But the result is the opposite.**

**This is DGTF.**

When someone says "Fast!":
- System 1 (D): "Yes!" → Start running
- DGTF (A/B): "Wait, what's the fastest way to get there?"

**The person who pauses to think beats the person who rushes to fail.**

Even in real emergencies, DGTF applies.
The difference is 5 seconds of pause instead of 5 minutes.
But it's still: Stop → Think → Act.

"This time it's really urgent, no time for DGTF!" 
→ This is exactly what System 1 says.
→ And it's exactly when DGTF is most needed.

### Self-Control Creates the Professional

**DGTF's core is not external but internal.**

```
❌ Wrong understanding:
"DGTF = Ask manager for more time"
"DGTF = Schedule negotiation skill"
"DGTF = Change external environment"

✅ Correct understanding:
"DGTF = Control your own System 1"
"DGTF = Manage inner 'Hurry!' impulse"
"DGTF = Habit of controlling yourself"
```

**Robert Martin's "Clean Coder" says:**

```
"Be able to say No"
"Don't yield to pressure"
"Be a Professional"
```

**But "How"?**

Clean Coder tells you "what" to do.  
DGTF tells you "how" to do it.  

**DGTF is that "How":**

```
1. Recognize System 1's "Hurry!" impulse
   → "Am I rushing right now?"
   → "Is my heart rate up?"
   → "Tunnel vision?"

2. Stop and activate System 2
   → Deep breath
   → Hands off keyboard
   → "Wait, let me think"

3. Judge thoughtfully and proceed
   → Check ROD document
   → Check TFD tests
   → Verify step by step
```

**Result of Self-Control:**

```
Person who can control themselves
    ↓
Maintain quality under pressure
    ↓
Earn trust through results
    ↓
Clean Coder's "Professional"
    ↓
Negotiation becomes unnecessary (because there's trust)
```

**Practical Scenario:**

```
Situation:
Friday afternoon 4 PM
Manager: "Please fix this bug by today"
Inner voice: "Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!"

❌ System 1 Response:
→ Open code
→ Fix where it looks problematic
→ "It works!"
→ Commit & Push
→ (Monday: Another bug appears)

✅ DGTF Response:
→ "Wait." (Recognize System 1)
→ Deep breath (Pause)
→ "What's the cause of this bug?" (Activate System 2)
→ Check logs, check tests
→ Identify cause
→ Add test
→ Fix
→ Confirm test passes
→ Commit & Push
→ (Monday: Stable)
```

**Professional earns trust through results:**

```
3 months later:

Developer without DGTF:
- Quick fixes, frequent bugs
- Manager: "Another bug?"
- Trust ↓
- More pressure
- Vicious cycle

Developer with DGTF:
- Thoughtful fixes, stable results
- Manager: "I can trust that person"
- Trust ↑
- Autonomy ↑
- Virtuous cycle
```

----------

### DGTF Workflow (Three Theories Integration)

**5-Step Process:**
- Step 1: Recognize - Kahneman
	"Am I rushing right now?"

	Check:
	- Heart rate increased?
	- "Hurry" thoughts repeating?
	- Want to skip verification?

	→ Confirm System 1 trigger
	→ Recognize danger

- Step 2: Pause - DGTF
	"Wait, let me stop"

	Action:
	- Hands off keyboard
	- 3 deep breaths
	- Wait 5 seconds
	- Ask "What's rushing me?"

	→ Suppress System 1
	→ Prepare to activate System 2

- Step 3: Check - Systems Thinking + ROD + TFD
	"Check the whole system"

	- Questions:
		- Did I check ROD design document?
		- Did I check TFD test cases?
		- Does this affect other parts? (Systems Thinking)
		- What feedback is there? (Meadows)
		- Is there a contradiction? (TRIZ)

	→ Understand whole system
	→ Check Missing
	→ Analyze impact

- Step 4: Plan - System 2
	"Plan carefully"

	- Questions:
		- In what order?
		- How to test?
		- Expected time?
		- Who to ask if stuck?

	→ Clear plan
	→ Predictable progress

- Step 5: Execute - DGTF + Feedback
	"Proceed carefully"

	- Action:
	→ Implement one service at a time
	→ Test at each step
	→ Check feedback (Meadows)
	→ Verify while progressing
	→ If problem found → Back to Step 2 (Pause)

### Communication (Three Theories Applied)

**With Manager/Client:**
- ❌ Bad Response (System 1):
"Yes, I'll do it right away!"
→ No plan
→ Rework
→ Trust decreases

- ✅ Good Response (System 2 + Systems Thinking):
	- Step 1: Recognize
	"This is an important request"
	"Need to answer carefully"

	- Step 2: Secure time
	"I'll give you accurate timeline after checking"
	→ Secure time to activate System 2

	- Step 3: Analysis (30 min)
		- ROD perspective: How many services?
		- Systems Thinking: Impact on other parts?
		- TFD: Test scope?
		- TRIZ: What contradictions?

	- Step 4: Honest estimate
	"I need 3 days"

	- Step 5: Explain (business value)
		- "If done carefully:
			 - No bugs → Customer satisfaction
			 - No rework → Cost savings
			 - Stable → Risk reduction"
		 - "If rushed:
			 - Bugs → Emergency fixes
			 - Rework → Takes longer
			 - Technical debt → Future slowdown"
		- "Result:
			→ Build trust
			→ Realistic schedule
			→ Successful deployment"

**Schedule Negotiation (TRIZ Contradiction Resolution):**

- Contradiction:
	"Fast deployment" vs "High quality"

- TRIZ Resolution:
	1. Condition Separation:
	   Simple features → Fast (2 days)
	   Complex features → Carefully (5 days)

	2. Time Separation:
	   Phase 1: Core features only (3 days)
	   Phase 2: Additional features (2 days)

	3. System Level Resolution:
	   "I need X days.
	   
	   But with systematic approach:
	   - Introduce automation tools (initial investment)
	   - Reusable components
	   - Faster next time
	   
	   Long-term benefit"

### "DGTF ≠ Slow, DGTF ≠ Willpower" (TRIZ Contradiction Resolution)

**Common Misconceptions:**
```
❌ DGTF = Work slowly
❌ DGTF = Low productivity
❌ DGTF = Requires willpower to resist rushing
❌ DGTF = Enduring the urge to go fast
```

**Truth:**
```
✅ DGTF = Work thoughtfully
✅ DGTF = Quality first
✅ DGTF = Sustainable pace
✅ DGTF = More effective, not more effortful
```

**DGTF does not consume willpower. It saves energy.**

```
Without DGTF:
  Rush → Bug → Debug → Fix → New bug → More debug
  → Exhaustion → More mistakes → Cycle continues
  → Energy drained

With DGTF:
  Think → Implement correctly → Done
  → Energy saved → Better decisions → Positive cycle
```

**The Agile Analogy:**

Some teams say: "This project is easy, let's do Agile."

This is backwards.

Agile is MORE effective for HARD projects.
Easy projects can survive any methodology.

**DGTF is the same.**

```
❌ "I have time, so I'll use DGTF"
✅ "I'm under pressure, so I NEED DGTF"
```

The harder the situation, the more DGTF helps.
DGTF is not a luxury for relaxed times.
DGTF is a necessity for difficult times.

**Paradox:**

- TRIZ Analysis:
	Apparent contradiction: "Thoughtfulness" vs "Speed"
	Reality: Not a contradiction (resolved by time separation)

```
- Meadows Analysis:
	"Rushing lengthens feedback loop"
	"Thoughtfulness makes feedback immediate"
	→ Overall system converges faster

### Anti-Patterns (Analyzed with Three Theories)

**1. Ego ("I'm good") - Kahneman**
- ❌ Symptom:
	"I'm experienced, don't need to check"

- Kahneman Analysis:
	- System 1 overconfidence
	- Confirmation bias
	- Ability illusion

- Result:
	→ More mistakes
	→ Trust decreases

- ✅ Solution:
	"More experience = More careful"
	"Humility = Sign of expertise"

- System 2 Application:
	- "Did I miss anything?"
	- "Other people's opinions?"
	- "Get a review"

**2. Pressure ("Hurry hurry")**

- ❌ Symptom:
	"Need to hurry, just do it rough!"

- Kahneman: System 1 dominance
	Systems Thinking: Only see parts
	TRIZ: Bad compromise

- Result:
	→ Technical debt
	→ Takes longer

- ✅ Solution:
"Do it carefully once"

- TRIZ: Contradiction resolution
	- Time separation
	- Step-by-step approach
- Meadows: Use feedback
	- Continuous verification
	- Early detection

**3. Momentum-Driven - Systems Thinking**

- ❌ Symptom:
	"Just start and see"
	"Learn while doing"

- Systems Thinking Problem:
	- Not seeing whole system
	- Not identifying relationships
	- Can't find Missing

- Result:
	→ Get stuck in the middle
	→ Restart repeatedly

- ✅ Solution:
	"Plan then start"

- ROD: Complete design
	Systems Thinking: Understand whole
	DGTF: Thoughtful progress

### What DGTF Does NOT Solve

**DGTF is not a solution for everything.**

Being clear about its boundaries prevents false promises and disappointment.

**DGTF does NOT fix:**

1. **Toxic Organizations**
   - If "slow and careful" gets you fired
   - If unreasonable deadlines are the norm
   - If quality is punished, not rewarded
   → This is not a DGTF problem. This is an environment problem.

2. **Irrational Managers**
   - If careful work is not recognized
   - If only "looking busy" matters
   - If results don't earn trust
   → DGTF cannot change other people's attitudes.

3. **Fundamentally Broken Systems**
   - Legacy code that needs complete rewrite
   - Architectural problems beyond individual control
   → DGTF is for prevention, not repair.

**The Answer: Escape.**

```
If the environment doesn't allow DGTF:
Option 1: Leave that environment.
Option 2: Apply DGTF within the small scope you can control.
```

**Option 2 is key:**

DGTF is an internal process.
- Taking 3 seconds to think before typing - nobody notices.
- Checking the design before coding - invisible to others.
- Pausing when you feel "hurry" - only you know.

**From the outside, you look the same.**
**Only the results are better.**

DGTF is not about declaring to your organization.
DGTF is about quietly controlling yourself.

### Practical Tips (Integrated Application)

**1. Use Timer (Feedback Loop):**

- Pomodoro Technique + DGTF:
	- 25 min focus (System 2):
		- Implement one service
		- No interruptions
		- Apply DGTF

	- 5 min break (Feedback - Meadows):
		□ "Was I rushing?" (Kahneman)
		□ Run tests (TFD)
		□ Code review (self)
		□ Check whole system (Systems Thinking)
		□ Plan next task
		□ Any contradictions? (TRIZ)

	- After 4 iterations:
		15-30 min long break
	- Review overall progress
	- Recheck ROD design
	- Check if direction change needed


**2. Checklist (Three Theories Integration):**

```
Before coding starts (System 2):
□ Understood requirements? (clearly)
□ Checked ROD design? (Systems Thinking)
□ Checked TFD tests? (feedback)
□ Implementation method clear? (plan)
□ Contradiction resolution? (TRIZ)

During coding (every 25 min - DGTF):
□ Following design? (ROD)
□ Am I rushing? (Kahneman - danger!)
□ Writing tests? (TFD)
□ Checking feedback? (Meadows)
□ Stuck for 30+ minutes → Ask!

Before commit (final verification):
□ All tests pass? (TFD)
□ Code review (self)? (System 2)
□ Removed unnecessary code? (TRIZ - ideality)
□ Checked system impact? (Systems Thinking)
□ Documentation updated?

```

**3. Buddy System (Feedback):**

- Pair with colleague (Meadows - Feedback):

- Morning (Plan):
	"What will you do today?"
	→ Share ROD design
	→ Check each other
	→ Missing check

- Lunch (Mid-check):
	"How's it going?"
	→ Progress status
	→ "Am I rushing?" check
	→ Discuss stuck parts

- Evening (Retrospective):
	"How was today?"
	→ System 1 rampage moments
	→ Lessons learned
	→ Tomorrow's plan

**4. Retrospective (Continuous Improvement):**

- Daily Retrospective:

	Kahneman Questions:
	"When was System 1 activated today?"
	"What was the trigger?"
	"How did I respond?"

	Systems Thinking Questions:
	"Did I see the whole system?"
	"Did I use feedback?"
	"Did I find Missing?"

	TRIZ Questions:
	"What contradictions were there?"
	"How did I resolve them?"
	"Better solution?"

	DGTF Questions:
	"Was I thoughtful?"
	"Moments I rushed?"
	"How to do it next time?"

### DGTF Checklist (Theory-Based)

**Daily:**

```
Kahneman (System 1 Control):
□ Recognizing System 1 triggers?
□ Stopping when feeling "hurry" impulse?
□ Activating System 2?

Systems Thinking (See Whole):
□ Seeing whole system?
□ Analyzing impact?
□ Checking feedback?

TRIZ (Problem Solving):
□ Identifying contradictions?
□ Resolving without compromise?

Practice:
□ Checking ROD design?
□ Checking TFD tests?
□ Proceeding carefully?
□ Verifying while progressing?

```

### Practical Example: E-commerce Shopping Cart

**Requirements:**

```
Users can add products to cart
Change quantities
And checkout
```

----------

**Day 1-2: ROD Design (Systems Thinking + TRIZ)**

- Systems Thinking Analysis:
	- Identify whole system:
		- Cart system (main)
		- Product system (connected)
		- Inventory system (connected)
		- Payment system (connected)
		- Order system (connected)
	- System boundary:
		- Inside: Cart CRUD, calculation
		- Outside: Payment processing, shipping
	- Identify relationships:
		- Cart ↔ Product (lookup)
		- Cart ↔ Inventory (check)
		- Cart → Order (convert)
	- Feedback loops:
		- Inventory change → Cart update
		- Price change → Total recalculation

- TRIZ Analysis:
	- Contradiction:
		- "Fast cart lookup" vs "Accurate price/inventory"
	- Resolution:
		- Cache (fast) + Periodic refresh (accurate)
		- Condition separation: Lookup uses cache, checkout uses real-time
	- Prior action:
		- Design all validations in advance
		- Predict error cases
	- Service Chain Design:
		- Cart Lookup:
			1. ValidateUserId
			   - Systems: Input validation (system boundary)
			2. FindCartByUserId
			   - Systems: Data retrieval element
			3. EnrichCartItemsWithProductInfo
			   - Systems: Connection (product system)
			4. CalculateCartTotal
			   - Systems: Calculation element
		- Add Product:
			1. ValidateUserId
			2. ValidateProductId
			3. CheckProductAvailability
			   - Systems: Connection (inventory system)
			   - TRIZ: Prior action
			4. FindCartByUserId
			5. CheckItemExistsInCart
			6. AddOrUpdateCartItem
			7. RecalculateCartTotal
				- Systems: Feedback (total update)
			8. SaveCart
		- Change Quantity:
			1. ValidateUserId
			2. ValidateCartItemId
			3. ValidateQuantity
			4. FindCartByUserId
			5. FindCartItem
			6. CheckProductStock
			   - Systems: Connection (inventory)
			   - TRIZ: Prior counteraction
			7. UpdateCartItemQuantity
			8. RecalculateCartTotal
			   - Systems: Feedback
			9. SaveCart

		- Remove Item:
			1. ValidateUserId
			2. ValidateCartItemId
			3. FindCartByUserId
			4. RemoveCartItem
			5. RecalculateCartTotal
			6. SaveCart

	- Systems Thinking Verification:
	✓ All elements identified
	✓ All relationships clear
	✓ System boundary defined
	✓ Feedback loop exists

	- TRIZ Verification:
	✓ Contradiction resolved
	✓ Prior action applied
	✓ Segmentation principle applied

	- Kahneman Verification:
	✓ Designed with System 2
	✓ No Missing

----------

**Day 3-4: TFD Test Design (Feedback + Prior Counteraction)**

- Meadows Feedback Design:
	- Feedback for each service:
		- Input → Process → Output
		- Output verification → Next input
		- Error → Immediate feedback

- TRIZ Prior Counteraction:
	- Predict all error cases:
		- Non-existent user
		- Non-existent product
		- Out of stock
		- Quantity limit exceeded
		- Concurrent access
		- Database failure

Kahneman System 2 Analysis:
1. Cart Lookup Tests:
	- Normal:
		- Valid user → Return cart
		- Empty cart → Empty list
	- Error:
		- Non-existent user → ErrUserNotFound
		- Invalid user ID format → ErrInvalidUserId
	- Edge:
		- Very old cart → Refresh product info
		- Contains deleted product → Filter out
2. Add Product Tests:
	- Normal:
		- New product → Added
		- Existing product → Quantity increased
	- Error (TRIZ Prior Counteraction):
		- Out of stock → ErrOutOfStock
		- Invalid product → ErrInvalidProduct
		- Quantity limit exceeded → ErrQuantityExceeded
	- Edge:
		- Concurrent add of same product → Consistency
		- Product price changing → Latest price

3. Change Quantity Tests:
	- Normal:
		- Valid quantity → Changed
	- Error:
		- Insufficient stock → ErrInsufficientStock
		- 0 or negative → ErrInvalidQuantity
		- Non-existent item → ErrItemNotFound
	- Edge:
		- Very large quantity → Apply limit
		- Concurrent quantity change → Lock

4. Remove Item Tests:
	- Normal:
		- Existing item → Removed
	- Error:
		- Non-existent item → ErrItemNotFound

5. Integration Tests (Systems Thinking):
	- Scenarios:
		- Add → Change quantity → Remove
		- Concurrent access (2 people same cart)
		- Add during inventory change
		- Calculate total during price change
	- Feedback verification:
		- Is total correct after each operation
		- Is inventory reservation correct

6. E2E Tests:
	- Complete flow:
		- View cart (empty)
		- Add product A
		- Add product B
		- Increase product A quantity
		- Remove product B
		- Verify total
		- Checkout

- Completion Criteria:
	✓ All unit tests pass
	✓ All integration tests pass
	✓ E2E tests pass
	✓ Coverage > 80%
	✓ Concurrency tests pass

## Part 6: Practical Guide for Junior Developers

### Getting Started

#### Understanding Theory (Basics)

To apply the methodology effectively, it helps to understand the basic concepts of three theories.

**Kahneman - Human Thinking:**
- System 1: Fast and automatic, intuitive 
- System 2: Slow and intentional, logical 
- Pressure → System 1 dominant → Risk of bad decisions 
- Key: When to use which thinking

**Meadows - Systems Thinking:**
- See the whole (don't just see parts) 
- Understand relationships (connections between elements) 
- Feedback loops (output → input) 
- Key: Understand whole system and flow

**TRIZ - Problem Solving:**
- Contradiction: "Improve A → B worsens" (fast vs quality) 
- Resolution: Don't compromise, resolve contradiction 
- Prior action: Prevent before problem occurs 
- Key: Creative problem solving patterns

---
#### Starting with ROD

**Start Small (Systems Thinking):**

- ❌ Design entire system from start
   → Meadows: "Can't understand whole at once"

- ✅ Start:
	1. Select single feature (e.g., login)
	   → Systems Thinking: Small boundary
	2. Write service chain for that feature
	   → Kahneman: Activate System 2
	   → TRIZ: Segmentation principle
	3. Get senior review
	   → Meadows: Feedback
	4. Apply feedback
	   → Continuous improvement
	5. Move to next feature
	   → Gradual expansion


**Use Template (Theory Integration):**

```markdown
## Feature: [Feature Name]

### Requirements
[Briefly describe requirements]

### Systems Thinking Analysis
- System this feature belongs to:
- Related systems:
- System boundary:
- Feedback loops:

### TRIZ Analysis
- Expected contradictions:
- Resolution principles:

### Service Chain (ROD)
1. [ServiceName](input)
   → Output: [output]
   → Errors: [possible errors]
   → Systems Thinking: [role]
   → TRIZ: [applied principle]

2. [ServiceName](input)
   → Output: [output]
   → Errors: [possible errors]
   → Systems Thinking: [role]

[... continue]

### Kahneman Check
[ ] Designed with System 2?
[ ] System 1 rampage prevention exists?

### Systems Thinking Check
[ ] All elements identified?
[ ] All relationships clear?
[ ] System boundary defined?
[ ] Feedback loop exists?

### TRIZ Check
[ ] Prior action applied?
[ ] Contradiction resolved?

### Verification
[ ] Requirements achievable with service chain alone?
[ ] Not using Constructor?
[ ] Not using Static?
[ ] No Missing?

### SOLID Application
- [ServiceName]: [Interface definition]

```
----------

#### Starting with TFD

**Start with Simple Tests (Meadows Feedback):**

```go
// Start: Happy path + one error
// Kahneman: Carefully with System 2

func TestUserService(t *testing.T) {
    // Happy path (normal case)
    t.Run("ValidInput_ShouldSucceed", func(t *testing.T) {
        // 🔹 Systems Thinking: Normal flow
        // Arrange
        service := NewUserService(mockRepo)
        
        // Act
        result, err := service.CreateUser("valid@email.com")
        
        // Assert (Meadows: Check feedback)
        if err != nil {
            t.Errorf("Expected no error, got %v", err)
        }
        if result == nil {
            t.Error("Expected result, got nil")
        }
    })
    
    // One error (TRIZ: Prior counteraction)
    t.Run("InvalidEmail_ShouldReturnError", func(t *testing.T) {
        // 🔹 TRIZ: Predict error case
        service := NewUserService(mockRepo)
        
        _, err := service.CreateUser("invalid-email")
        
        // Meadows: Feedback (error detection)
        if err == nil {
            t.Error("Expected error, got nil")
        }
    })
}

// ✓ Start simple
// ✓ Add cases gradually
// ✓ Kahneman: Add carefully with System 2

```

**Set Up Feedback Loop (Meadows):**

```
Write test → Run (Red) → Implement → Run (Green)
     ↑                                    ↓
     ←────────────────────────────────────┘
              Feedback loop
```              
- Meadows:
	"Fast feedback = Fast learning"

- Practice:
	- Run tests: Every 5 minutes
	- All tests: Before every commit
	- Integration tests: Daily

----------

#### Starting with DGTF

**Self-Observation (Kahneman):**

```markdown
## Daily DGTF Journal

### Date: 2025-01-15

### Theory Application

#### Kahneman Observation
Rushed moment:
Time: 10:30 AM
Situation: Fixing a bug
Trigger: "Need to fix fast" (System 1)
Signal: Heart rate up, restless
Decision: Used global variable
Result: Affected other parts, new bug appeared

Analysis:
- Didn't recognize System 1 activation
- Skipped pause step
- Failed to activate System 2

Lesson:
- Need early signal detection
- Need pause practice

#### Systems Thinking Observation
Did I see whole system: ❌
- Only saw part (just the buggy function)
- Didn't analyze other parts impact
- Ignored feedback

Lesson:
- Must analyze impact before fixing
- Check related systems

#### TRIZ Observation
Contradiction: "Fast fix" vs "Accurate fix"
Resolution attempt: Compromise (fast and rough)
Result: Failed

Better resolution:
- Time separation: 1 hour now carefully
- Result: Save 3 hours of rework

### Well-done Moment
Time: 2:00 PM
Situation: Starting new feature implementation

Kahneman Applied:
- Recognized System 1 trigger
- Pause: "Design first"
- Activated System 2

Systems Thinking Applied:
- Checked ROD design
- Understood whole system
- Analyzed impact

TRIZ Applied:
- Prior action (predicted errors)
- Tests first

DGTF Applied:
- Followed 5-step workflow
- Careful implementation

Result:
- Clear implementation
- No problems
- Tests passed

Lesson:
- Three theories + DGTF effective
- Keep practicing

```

----------

### Common Junior Mistakes and Solutions (Theory Analysis)

#### Mistake 1: "I'll design while coding"

- ❌ Symptom: "Just start coding and see" / "Figure it out while doing"
	- Theory Analysis:
		- Kahneman:
			- System 1's immediacy
			- "Action before thinking"
			- Cognitive laziness
		- Systems Thinking: 
			- Not seeing whole
			- Only seeing parts
			- Not identifying relationships
		- TRIZ:
			- Ignoring prior action
			- Reactive problem solving
			- Bad compromise repeated

	- Result:
		→ Get stuck in the middle
		→ Restart multiple times
		→ Time wasted
		→ Stress

- ✅ Solution (Theory Applied):
	- Kahneman:
		"30 min design (System 2) =
		 3 hours implementation (System 1 controlled)"
	- Systems Thinking:
		"Understand whole system =
		 10x more effective than partial optimization"
	- TRIZ:
		"Prior action (design) =
		 10x more efficient than post action (rework)"

- Action:
	1. Use ROD template
	2. Understand whole with Systems Thinking
	3. Write service chain with Kahneman System 2
	4. TRIZ prior action (predict Missing)
	5. Get 5 min senior review
	6. Start implementation after approval

#### Mistake 2: "Tests later"

- ❌ Symptom: "Just make it work first, tests later..."
	- Theory Analysis:
		- Meadows (Systems Thinking):
			- No feedback loop
			- Not verifying output
			- System behavior uncertain
		- Kahneman:
			- System 1: "Finish fast"
			- Future discounting (later = never)
		- TRIZ:
			- Ignoring prior counteraction
			- Problem discovery delayed
			- Fix cost 10x
		- Result:
			→ "Later" never comes
			→ Hard to test structure
			→ Afraid to refactor
			→ Many bugs

- ✅ Solution (Theory Applied):
	- Meadows:
		"Feedback loop = Learning speed"
		"Tests = Immediate feedback"
	- TRIZ:
		"Prior counteraction = Prevention"
		"10 min now = 1 hour later saved"
	- Kahneman:
		"System 2: Consider long-term benefit"
	- Action:
		1. Write test structure before implementing
		2. Confirm red (failing test)
		3. Implement
		4. Confirm green (pass)
		5. Meadows feedback: "This part done"
		6. Move to next test

#### Mistake 3: "Need to finish fast"

- ❌ Symptom: "Manager is pushing" / "Demo is tomorrow" / "Within this sprint..."
	- Theory Analysis:
		- Kahneman:
			- External pressure → System 1 activation
			- "Hurry hurry" thinking
			- Ignore long-term results
		- Systems Thinking:
			- Only see parts (immediate task)
			- Ignore whole system impact
			- Ignore feedback (warning signs)
		- TRIZ:
			- Bad compromise: Sacrifice quality
			- Avoid contradiction
			- Short-term solution
	- System 1 Rampage:
		→ Skip design
		→ Skip tests
		→ Hardcoding
	- Result:
		→ Takes longer (rework)
		→ Many bugs
		→ Trust decreases

- ✅ Solution (Theory Applied):
	1. Kahneman: Recognize System 1
		"I'm being pressured now" awareness
		→ Pause
		→ Activate System 2
	2. Systems Thinking: Analyze whole impact
		Understand work scope with ROD:
		- How many services?
		- Other system impact?
		- Feedback loops?

	3. Clarify completion criteria with TFD:
		- Test scope
		- Verification criteria

	4. TRIZ: Resolve contradiction
		- Contradiction: "Fast deployment" vs "High quality"
		- Resolution:
			- Time separation: Phase 1 (core) + Phase 2 (additional)
			- Condition separation: Simple parts fast, complex parts careful

	5. Honest estimate:
	"Analysis shows X days needed"

	6. Negotiate with manager:
	"Three options:
	 A) Rush in 2 days (System 1)
	    → Many bugs
	    → 3 days rework after 1 week
	    → Total 5 days, unstable
	 B) Careful in 3 days (System 2 + DGTF)
	    → Stable
	    → No rework
	    → Total 3 days, stable
	 C) Phased approach (TRIZ Time Separation)
	    → Phase 1: Core 2 days
	    → Phase 2: Additional 1 day
	    → Total 3 days, incremental value
	Which is better for business?"

	- Result:
		→ Build trust
		→ Realistic schedule
		→ Successful deployment

## Part 7: Measuring Success

### Individual Level Metrics (Theory-Based)

#### ROD Metrics (Systems Thinking):

- ✅ Good Signs (Meadows - Complete System):
	- Rarely "I need this but it's not in design" during implementation
		  → Missing elimination effect
		  → Whole system understood
	- Design and implementation match
		  → Leverage point utilized
	- Respond to requirement changes by replacing services
		  → Adaptable system
	- Refactoring is mostly removal
		  → TRIZ ideality increase

- ❌ Bad Signs:
	- Continuously discovering Missing during implementation
		  → Incomplete system
		  → System 2 lacking
	- "How do I make this?" frequently
		  → Prior action lacking (TRIZ)
	- Requirement change requires whole modification
		  → Rigid system structure
	- Using Constructor, Static a lot
		  → Systems thinking lacking


#### TFD Metrics (Meadows - Feedback):

- ✅ Good Signs (Effective Feedback Loop):
	- Test coverage > 80%
		  → Complete feedback
	- Tests written before/during implementation
		  → TRIZ prior counteraction
	- Tests catch bugs early
		  → Fast feedback loop
	- Tests ensure safety during refactoring
		  → Confidence from feedback

- ❌ Bad Signs:
	- Test coverage < 50%
		  → Feedback lacking
		  → Meadows: "What you can't see, you can't manage"
	- Tests written after implementation
		  → Post action (TRIZ reverse)
	- Bugs found in production
		  → Feedback loop slow
	- "No time to write tests"
		  → Kahneman System 1 dominance

#### DGTF Metrics (Kahneman - System 2 Utilization):

- ✅ Good Signs (Effective System 2 Use):
	- Few corrections in code review
		  → Careful implementation
	- Not saying "I rushed"
		  → System 1 controlled
	- Predictable completion time
		  → Plan with System 2
	- Sustainable without burnout
		  → TRIZ: Contradiction resolved (fast vs quality)

- ❌ Bad Signs:
	- Many "careless mistakes" in code review
		  → System 1 rampage
	- Often saying "Had to hurry..."
		  → Not recognizing System 1 trigger
	- Schedule estimates always wrong
		  → System 1's optimism bias
	- Stress, burnout
		  → Unsustainable speed

## Part 8: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: Isn't ROD over-engineering?

**A:** No. ROD is about **defining**, not **implementing**.

- Over-engineering (YAGNI violation): "Build everything for the future"
	→ Implement unnecessary features
	→ Complexity increases
	→ Cost increases

- ROD (Systems Thinking): "Define everything needed"
	→ Only define (not implement)
	→ Implement only what's needed
	→ Remove unnecessary
	→ Clear structure

- Meadows perspective: "Understanding system structure allows predicting behavior"

- ROD Application:
	- Definition phase (1 hour):
		- Define 20 services
		- Understand whole system
	- Implementation phase:
		- Implement only 15
		- 5 are "not needed now" → Remove

- TRIZ:
	→ Informed decision
	→ Prior action (problem prevention)

----------

### Q: Isn't TFD slower than code-first?

**A:** Looks slower short-term, but much faster long-term.

TFD saves 7 hours (41%)!
```
- Meadows:
"Fast feedback = Fast learning = Fast fix"
"Slow feedback = Slow learning = Much rework"

----------

### Q: Does DGTF mean "work slowly"?

**A:** DGTF is about **thoughtfulness**, not speed.

- TRIZ Contradiction Resolution:
	- Apparent contradiction:
	"Thoughtfulness" vs "Speed"

	- Traditional compromise:
		Thoughtful → Slow
		Fast → Careless

- TRIZ Resolution: Time Separation

Rushing Developer (System 1):
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Behavior:              │
│ • Write 100 lines/day  │
│ • 10 bugs              │
│ • Rework needed        │
│                        │
│ Kahneman: System 1     │
│ Systems: Only see parts│
│ Result: Low productivity│
└────────────────────────┘
```
DGTF Developer (System 2):
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Behavior:              │
│ • Write 50 lines/day   │
│ • 1 bug                │
│ • No rework            │
│                        │
│ Kahneman: System 2     │
│ Systems: See whole     │
│ Result: High productiv │
└────────────────────────┘
```
- Key (Meadows):
	"Lines of code written" ≠ Productivity
	"Value integrated into system" = Productivity

- Paradox:
	Looks slow (thoughtfulness)
	Actually fast (no rework)
	→ TRIZ: Contradiction resolved

----------

### Q: Manager wants fast results?

**A:** Explain with business value.

- ❌ Technical terms (Kahneman: Expert's curse): "Making service chain with ROD and understanding whole with Systems Thinking and resolving contradictions with TRIZ..."
	→ Manager doesn't understand
	→ Communication fails

- ✅ Business value (Manager's language):   "With 3 more days investment: 
	- Meadows perspective (System effect):
		 - 70% bug reduction
		  → Customer satisfaction increase
		  → Churn reduction
		 - 50% maintenance reduction
		  → Cost savings
		  → More time for new features
	- Kahneman perspective (Risk management):
		-  Predictable schedule
		  → Business planning possible
		  → Risk reduction
	- TRIZ perspective (Innovation):
		- Adaptable structure
		  → Fast market response
		  → Competitive advantage
	- If rushed:
		- Meadows:
			-  Bug explosion in 2 weeks
			  → Emergency fixes (10x cost)
			  → Customer trust drops
			- Technical debt
			  → Speed gradually slows
			  → Lose leverage point
		- Kahneman:
			-  System 1 decision
			  → Bad design
			  → Long-term loss
		- TRIZ:
			-  Bad compromise
			  → Quality sacrificed
			  → Competitiveness drops
	
	Which is better for business?"

- Result:
	→ Data-based persuasion
	→ Long-term value understood
	→ Trust built

----------

### Q: How to apply to legacy codebase?

**A:** Apply gradually.

- Meadows Principle:
	"Don't try to change system all at once"
	"Accumulation of small changes makes big change"

- Never do:

	- ❌ "Complete rewrite!"
	   Meadows: "Sudden system change = Unpredictable"
	   Kahneman: "Planning fallacy" (System 1 optimism)
	   TRIZ: "Risk too high"
	   → High failure probability
	   → Business disruption

	- ✅ Gradual improvement
	   Meadows: "Accumulation of small changes"
	   Kahneman: "Carefully with System 2"
	   TRIZ: "Segmentation + Prior action"
	   → Risk manageable
	   → Continuous value delivery

### Essence (Theory + Methodology)

**ROD, TFD, DGTF are:**

```
❌ Not Principles
❌ Not Rules
❌ Not Processes
❌ Not Knowledge

✅ A Way of Thinking
✅ Habits
✅ Training
```

**The Critical Distinction: Understanding vs. Doing**

```
Understanding:
- Read this document → "I get it"
- Nod along → "Makes sense"
- Agree with everything → "I'll do this"
→ This is System 1 saying "Got it, next!"

Doing:
- Apply tomorrow → Struggle
- Fail → Learn
- Try again → Slightly better
- Repeat → Eventually natural
→ This is building habit through training
```

**Understanding ≠ Doing**

You can understand DGTF in 10 minutes.
You cannot DO DGTF without months of practice.

**Training, Not Learning**

```
Learning: Acquire knowledge (one-time)
Training: Build habit (continuous)

You don't "learn" to drive well.
You "train" to drive well.

You don't "learn" DGTF.
You "train" DGTF.
```

**Crossing the Hurdle is Not the End**

```
❌ "I applied DGTF once successfully!"
   → Finished? No. Tomorrow the pressure returns.

✅ "I applied DGTF today. I'll do it again tomorrow."
   → And the day after. And the week after.
   → Until it's no longer conscious effort.
```

**The Hardest Part**

The hardest thing about DGTF is not understanding it.
The hardest thing is:
- Keeping curiosity alive
- Maintaining doubt ("Is this really right?")
- Practicing continuously
- Not stopping after the first success

**This requires not technique, but attitude.**

---

**Think about driving.**

Basic driving principles:
- Green light means go
- Brake pedal stops the car
- Accelerator moves forward

Does knowing these principles make you a good driver?  

**No.**  

```
Driver who only knows principles:
- Green light → Just go
- Car ahead brakes → Sudden stop
- Someone cuts in → Gets angry
→ Accident risk, stress

Good driver:
- Green light → Check left/right then go (habit)
- Car ahead movement → Anticipate (way of thinking)
- Someone cuts in → Respond calmly (attitude)
→ Safe, comfortable
```

**Software is the same.**

```
Developer who only knows SOLID:
- "Dependency inversion? I know it"
- Under pressure → "Let me just new..."
→ Knows principles but can't follow

Developer with SOLID as habit:
- Even under pressure → Naturally uses interfaces
- Don't have to think → Ingrained
→ Principles automatically applied
```

**Difference between principles and habits:**

```
Principles/Rules:
- "You should do this" (externally enforced)
- Requires conscious effort
- Collapses under pressure
- Follow or break

Way of Thinking/Habits:
- "I think this way" (internalized)
- Works naturally
- Persists under pressure
- Don't need to think about it
```

**ROD, TFD, DGTF are methods to build those habits:**

- ROD: "See the whole first" way of thinking
  → Systems Thinking becomes habit
  
- TFD: "Define verifiably" way of thinking
  → Test first becomes habit
  
- DGTF: "Don't rush" habit
  → System 2 activation becomes habit

**When these habits are ingrained:**

```
You become the "Professional" Clean Coder talks about.
Professionals earn trust through results.
With trust, negotiation becomes unnecessary.
```

**As Kahneman said:**
> "System 2 is lazy" → Practice is needed

**As Meadows said:**
> "Systems thinking is a muscle" → Training is needed

**As Altshuller said:**
> "TRIZ is a tool" → Use it to get familiar

**ROD + TFD + DGTF:**
> "When it becomes habit, it's natural" → Practice consistently

## Final Words (Theory + Methodology Integration)

### Core Message

**Why Theory Matters:**

```
Methodology only:
"Do it this way" (What & How)
→ Just follow
→ Hard to apply creatively
→ Lack confidence

Theory + Methodology:
"Why do it this way" (Why) + "How" (How)
→ Understanding
→ Can apply creatively
→ Confidence
→ Creative application

```

**Power of Three Theories:**

```
Kahneman (Nobel Prize):
"How do humans think"
→ Understand yourself
→ Compensate weaknesses
→ Utilize strengths

Meadows (Systems Theory):
"How do systems work"
→ See the whole
→ Utilize leverage
→ Manage complexity

Altshuller (TRIZ):
"How to solve problems"
→ Resolve contradictions
→ Innovation patterns
→ Creativity
```
- Three Combined:
	→ Complete framework
	→ Optimal for software development
	→ Sustainable growth

----------

### Getting Started (From Today)

- Today:
	1. Read theory summary (1 hour)
	   - Kahneman System 1/2
	   - Meadows Systems Thinking
	   - TRIZ Contradiction
	2. Start daily observation
	   - System 1 triggers?
	   - See the system?
	   - Any contradictions?

	2. Share with teammates
	3. Continue theory learning
	4. Gradual expansion

----------

### Final Message

> **Kahneman:** "We are not as rational as we think we are. But knowing that, we can become more rational."   
> **Meadows:** "If you want to change a system, you must understand the system."  
> **Altshuller:** "Innovation is not talent but method. Anyone can learn."   
> **ROD + TFD + DGTF:** "Theory into practice. Knowledge into habit. Individual growth into team culture."   

----------

**This methodology is a journey.**

-   You don't have to be perfect
-   It's okay to make mistakes
-   You can go slowly

**What matters is:**

-   Trying to understand the theory
-   Practicing the methodology
-   Continuously improving
-   Sharing with others

**And remember:**

```
As Kahneman said:
"System 2 is lazy"
→ Practice is needed

As Meadows said:
"Systems thinking is a muscle"
→ Training is needed

As Altshuller said:
"TRIZ is a tool"
→ Use it to get familiar

ROD + TFD + DGTF:
"When it becomes habit, it's natural"
→ Practice consistently

```
